## 💡 About Me

I'm an early-career robotics developer with a strong interest in **autonomous mobile robots**, currently building hands-on experience in **Python** and the **ROS 1 Navigation Stack**. I enjoy learning how robots perceive and navigate their environments using **sensor integration**, **localization**, and **path planning** tools within ROS.

I’ve worked on several guided and self-initiated projects using **Gazebo**, **RViz**, and **ROS 1 (Melodic/Noetic)**, where I focused on setting up robot simulation environments, integrating basic sensors like **LIDAR**, and exploring SLAM-based navigation.

## 📁 Projects

### 🔸 Basic ROS Navigation Demo (Self-Learning Project)

Set up a simple differential drive robot in **Gazebo** and configured the **ROS Navigation Stack** for autonomous movement in a simulated environment.

- Used **AMCL** for localization with a static map  
- Launched **move_base** to perform basic navigation to goal points  
- Tuned parameters for inflation/costmap layers to improve obstacle avoidance  
- Created a basic **URDF** file and configured sensor topics for **LIDAR**

### 🔸 ROS Mapping & SLAM Test (Tutorial-Based)

Followed online tutorials to explore **SLAM** using **GMapping** and **Hector SLAM**.

- Recorded and analyzed data using **rosbag**  
- Visualized mapping results in **RViz**  
- Understood key differences between mapping methods
